# ASSESSMENT 4: Behavioral Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. Use the Nugget + STAR method for each answer.

1. Why did you choose a career in software development?

- Nugget: during highschool i remember the school starting to transition into a tech base school where they integrated coding, and data science classes. i was fortunate enough to try both and found that coding was harder but i enjoyed it more than analyzing data.
- Situation: after getting out of the military i quickly found that my financial skills that i learned in the military ment nearly nothing, as i was passed up on nearly every finance job i applied for because i did not have a degree. thats when i quickly knew i had to make a career change and i figured out about VetTech which pays for schooling to learn a skill in the tech industry without using the GI Bill.
- Task: after researching different tech jobs i landed on software development and remember that i learned some stuff in high school and it might come slightly easier to me as i had some background in the subject 
- Action: after i decided what i wanted to learn i looked through the vetted schools that were on the VetTech list and started interviewing until i found the best match for me. 
- Result: i found LEARN to be the best match for me and i enjoyed the schedule they had planned for the course so i applied, was accepted and started my journey with LEARN Academy.

2. In previous roles, how have you helped teammates succeed?

- Nugget: being in the military there are many moments where there are times to help someone else succeed both physically or mentally.
- Situation: one i can remember vividly is when i was months away from getting out and one of my junior marines had a goal to rank up before i left. he had been passed up for promotion in previous months due to missing the mark by just a few points.
- Task:we had to get him to be over the cutting score which was growing slightly every month and to do so every week for about 2 months i helped him set goals, work towards those goals and achieve those goals. both physically and mentally. 
- Action: consistantly without fail we would workout together to get him to be physically fit and be able to complete the physical tests with high scores. as someone who was extremely proficient at my job, i taught him everything i know and showed him things even outside our imediate job scope that would allow him to work with other sections and take on more responsibilty. 
- Result: on March 1 2023 the marine i mentored was promoted to Corporal of marines.
